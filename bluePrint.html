	<p>Picture Standing in the middle of an ocean looking at the endless stretch of blue, you realise the majesty of the water body but you start wondering the significance of a single droplet that constitutes the thalassic. The tiny droplet seems so insignificant in comparison to the ocean that you start questioning its contribution to the ocean. Starting this project our team members felt like these tiny droplets-insignificant. 
<br><br>
Our scepticism stemmed from the belief that if major names in the industry can’t solve hunger what can four teenagers barely though their adolescence do about this global crisis. Hunger is a pressing issue which grips every nation of this world, yet stats on paper indicate that due to advances in agricultural practices and technology, hunger should be an unknown concept to the residents of this little planet called the Earth. The food we currently produce is capable of feeding 10 billion people, yet many sleep with an empty stomach every night and one in seven children lack the proper nutrition needed to support a healthy lifestyle. The gaps in the system are evident, we don’t lack the resources we just lack the means to deliver these resources to the right people efficiently. 
<br><br>
To find a solution to any problems we must turn to tales which inspire, excite and influence us. They hide within them treasures of knowledge which require a different angle to be noticed. Finding the solution to hunger required the same approach. With thousands of folk tales, legends, myths and fables to rift through, we ironically picked the most common tale for inspiration- The tale Of Robin Hood. The story of Robin Hood has inspired a plethora of media adaptations, but in every adaptation the root of the character remains the same - steal from the rich and give to poor. Distribution of resources to reduce inequality amongst people seems like an ideal solution to our problem yet we could not follow in the footsteps of our mentoring outlaw, primarily because stealing is unlawful and illegal. So in our adaptation of Robin Hood we stick to taking from the more fortunate and delivering it to the needy. 
<br><br>
When you sign up with this initiative you will be provided with a vessel that you would keep with you for a month.
<br><br>
For the entirety of the month you will put aside a fistful of raw rice/pulses/grains (The ration you choose below) in the vessel provided, before preparing food for your own family. The completely filled vessel would be collected by one of our volunteers at the end of the month.
<br><br>
The ration collected would be cleaned, repackaged and distributed to charities which specialise in feeding those in need.
<br><br>
1. The RobinHood Army
<br>
2. The Akshaypatra Foundation
<br><br>
Your contribution to the program would help feed not only your family but your excess will help feed a family less unfortunate than yours.
<br><br>
For the privileged ₹500, ₹1000, ₹1500 seem to be trivial amounts however donations of these sums can be used to sponsor a years worth of ration for a family. You can also contribute to this cause by donating small sums of money which we would use to purchase the appropriate goods and provide them to charities that provide food and catering facilities in government school and slums.
<br><br>
Will we achieve anything significant doing this? Honestly, we don’t know!
<br><br>
At the beginning we said we’re like tiny drops of water in an ocean, us being present or absent won’t make a difference, but every drop counts towards building the majestic ocean. We’ll try being ambitious but keep realistic expectations. We realise it’s impossible for us to end world hunger, but we can bring a small smile on a few faces. Who knows our tiny droplets might morph into a mighty cloud that gives birth to a whole new and different set of ideas and innovations or our droplets could just make a tiny space in this vast ocean of humanity and kindness.
